                question: "What is the lava made of?",
                answer: "We melt tephra from the 1918 Katla eruption. It is basaltic volcanic glass, containing 47% Silica, 14% Iron, 9% Calcium, 13% Aluminum, 4% Titanium, 5% Magnesium, 3% Sodium."

                question: "Does the lava produce toxic gases?",
                answer: "The lava erupted over 100 years ago and has lost all gases. When melted onto ice, it produces only water vapor. We have excellent air conditioning and regularly test air quality."

                question: "Why heat to 1100¬∞C?",
                answer: "While lava melts at 900¬∞C, we heat to 1100¬∞C to achieve the right viscosity for demonstrating natural lava flow. This temperature matches what you'd see in nature."

            cleaning: {

                    answer: "In our show, we break up the lava to release heat energy and collect it right after each show. Without intervention, the thickest parts would take up to 2 days to cool to room temperature. In nature, cooling time varies greatly depending on volume and thickness."
